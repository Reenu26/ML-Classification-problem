# ML-Classification-problem
In this work, we worked with the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn and applied five classification algorithms to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. The workflow included data preprocessing, implementing machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and comparing results.
steps include
loading and cleaning data( this file contains zero null values).Used StandardScaler to normalize the dataset, ensuring that all features have the same scale.
Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing using train_test_split().We implemented the following classification mode which are , Logistic Regression,Decision Tree Classifier,Random Forest Classifier
 Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).

 we can conclude Logistic Regression   with accuracy of 0.982456 is the best performing algoritham. and Decision Tree  with 0.912281is the least performing one. Random Forest,svm,k_nn have 0.956140  , 0.958904  0.9722 accuracy respectively.
